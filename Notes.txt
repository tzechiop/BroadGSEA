Input data:
	Expression dataset (res, gct, pcl, txt)
		Includes features (genes or probes), samples, and an expression value for each feature in each sample
	Phenotype labels (cls)
		Defines pehnotype labels and assigns those labels to the sample in the expression dataset. Phenotype labels can be categorical (ALL vs MLL) or continuous
	Gene sets (gmx or gmt)
		Defines one or more gene sets and the liste of genes in those gene sets
		Molecular Signature Database (MSigDb) is a publicly accessible collection of curated gene sets maintained by the GSEA team
	Chip annotations (Chip)
		Lists each probe on a DNA chip and its matching HUGO gene symbol.

Default ranking metric is signal-to-noise ratio

Gene family/cluster - A gene family is a set of several similar genes, formed by duplication of a single original gene, and generally with similar biochemical functions. One such family are the genes for human hemoglobin subunits; the ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes, called the α-globin and β-globin loci
